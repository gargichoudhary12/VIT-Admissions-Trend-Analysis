# VIT-Admissions-Trend-Analysis

**DESCRIPTION -** The main aim behind this project is to study the twitter tweets posted during a specific timeframe, like before and after the VITEEE exam and understand the sentiment of users, whether they are positive, negative or neutral. It is then compared with the admission rates every year, and checked how the sentiments of these tweets affect the rates. The data can be visualized and analyzed using dashboards that were created using Apache SuperSet.

The data for this was extracted through a twitter API and scraping methods (sns scrape). The data is loaded to a sentiment analysis machine learning model, that uses python libraries like pandas, textblob, wordcloud, nltk, matplotlib and re.

Using Apache SuperSet, dashboards are created and the statistics can be visualized using MySQL queries, for specific timeframes.

The key technologies used in this project are python, machine learning, NLP, data analysis, twitter API, Apache SuperSet and MySQL
